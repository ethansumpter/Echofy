A project to demo how to use APIs with Spotify's Web API. Aim is to get a functioning web application to display user's top songs/artists.

This project will imitate features of existing solutions (i.e. statsforspotify.com), however I will take steps to develop on their ideas and create a more well-rounded web app.

Some of these features include:
* Creating posters out of the user's top items (songs, artists, genres) for export to social media platforms
* Export top tracks to playlist
* Use the recommendation API to create a new playlist based on songs the user may like

The project will mainly be programmed in JavaScript.
